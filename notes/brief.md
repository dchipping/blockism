# comp0113-virtual-environments

## Definitions

- *Block*: World spawned objects to build structures
- *Structures*: Output object when multiple blocks are combined in a valid configuration
- *Configuration*: The blueprint which map a set of blocks into a single structure

## MVP
- World with only blocks of different colours
- User classes that can only pick-up certain coloured blocks
- When blocks are put together in valid configurations they change into a structure

## Basic Game Design
- What each class does i.e. (Red Class vs. Blue Class)
- Teaching level to you discover game dynamics
- Narrative behind the game e.g. Boss in Factory, Building a tower to escape water etc.
- Environments Asthetics
- Events based class changes

## Final TODO:
- Starting the game (selecting colours) - Daniel
- Tidying the environment up - Daniel
- Player class system working - Praveen
- Submitting structures to the van - Costa
- Debug blocks (e.g. Chair) - Harvey
- Deploy to oculus - Praveen

- Block spawning?
- Restricitng one person to planning room?
- Event based changing of roles?
- Couple more structures?
- Game levels?
- Maybe adding structures together to make bigger structures?
